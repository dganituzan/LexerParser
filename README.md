*** Assignment ***

Writing a program that will use as a calculator with a basic commands
while using Lexer and Parser.

*** Goals ***

The calculator is capable of doing the following things:
* Instant Operation: for example '2 + 3*4' will print '14'.
  or, for instance   (2+3)*4; will print 20.
  operators it can read: +,-,*,/. 
* Store Operation: for example 'a=4;' will store '4' and 'a = 4+2;' will store '6' in variable 'a'.
* Display Operation: for example 'a;' will print the contents of variable 'a'.
  also, 'b=2*(a-10) and than 'b;' will print -12.
* ';' should be the end of the command.

factor: return the value of a token. identifier , Integer, -factor and bracket expressions.
Main - The class where the user put in his command. Actually, all user access occurs there.

*** Running the program ***
Navigate to Start -> Run. Enter cmd in the commend li×že.
Set the path to your JDK bin directory, for example: "set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_161\bin".
At the run window enter the project source folder likewise: "cd JavaEclipseWorkspace/hello1.
Type "java Main" and follow the instuctions- start calulating.

*** Algoritems ***
None.
